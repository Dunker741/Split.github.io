    <p class="description">Croatia's second-largest city, Split (Spalato in Italian) is a great place to see Dalmatian life as it's really lived. Always buzzing, this exuberant city has just the right balance of tradition and modernity. Step inside Diocletian's Palace (a Unesco World Heritage site and one of the world's most impressive Roman monuments) and you'll see dozens of bars, restaurants and shops thriving amid the atmospheric old walls where Split life has been humming along for thousands of years.</p>

    <p class="description">Split is known for its beaches and the fortresslike complex at its center, Diocletian's Palace, erected by the Roman emperor in the 4th century. Once home to thousands, its sprawling remains include more than 200 buildings. Within its white stone walls and under its courtyards are a cathedral and numerous shops, bars, cafes, hotels and houses.</p>
    <h2 class="subject"><a name="travel">Travel</a></h2>
    <p class="description">Reaching Split is really easy. It is the second largest travel hub in Croatia after Zagreb. You can reach Split by plane, train, bus, ferry, and even a hydroplane.</p>
    <h2 class="subject"><a name="history">History</a></h2>
    <p class="description">The history of Split in its early days revolves around a Greek settlement founded in the area between the 3rd and 4th centuries. Its most famous historical development, however, came in 295 AD when Roman emperor Diocletian ordered a residence to be built there for his retirement, as it was close to the nearby large Roman settlement of Salona (present-day Solin, about 5km from Split).</p>
    <h2 class="subject"><a name="ttd">Things To Do</a></h2>
    <p class="description">Peristyle, an open-air pavilion, best seen at nighttime, brings you right back to Roman times.

Split Cathedral offers great views over the town from the top of its bell tower.

There are four town gates, each on one side of the palace: The Golden, Silver, Bronze and Iron Gate.

Just out of the Golden gate, you'll also see Gregory of Nin (Grgur Ninski) statue, work of renowned Croatian sculptor Ivan Mestrovic. Rub Gregory's tow for the plenitude of good luck.

You don't need to head to Egypt to see the original Egyptian sphinxes. Find the two of them in Split, on Peristyle, near Jupiter Temple that today serves as a baptistery.

It can take you one full day to explore Split numerous churches, palaces and museums.

"Let me pass" street is said to be the narrowest street in the world (not sure about this, but it is pretty narrow).

Piazza, or People's Square, became town's central point, in the 14th century. The square features few interesting landmarks and buildings, and it's always alive with people.

Vocni Trg, or Fruit Square, owes its name to the fruit market that once took place here daily. Today, it boasts few cafes, shops, Venetian Octagonal Tower from the 15th centuries; the 17th century baroque Palace Milesi; and a statue of Marko Marulic, a 15th century poet, and a father of Croatian literature. The statue is a work of famed Croatian sculptor - Ivan Mestrovic.

We've covered only a fragment of landmarks, and historical buildings to find in old town Split. Don't limit yourself to these few. Just explore this magnificent town, and discover it for yourself.</p>
